# BufferedReader_g99Lesson
We're reading a file and printing it's contents. Using while loop to help facilitate this process along with BufferedReader

Growing Pains: during coding session
	-Initially saved the file was 'FileReader' which ALREADY EXIST in my Import setttings! This fixed a majority of issues.
	-had syntax errors for 'readline()' instead of 'readLine()' and also I entered printStactTrace() instead of printStackTrace()..
	-Was fighting thru this for while until I installed Eclipse to help figure out the errors.
	-IntelliJ was not as friendly for me this time.  Had trouble importing the file into the project, than moved to eclipse.
