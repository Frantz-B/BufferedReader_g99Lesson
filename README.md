# BufferedReader_g99Lesson
We're reading a file and printing it's contents using the `while` loop to help facilitate this process along with BufferedReader class

####Growing Pains: during coding session
* Initially saved the file was `FileReader` which ALREADY EXIST in my Import setttings! This fixed a majority of issues.
* had syntax errors for `readline()` instead of `readLine()` and also I entered `printStactTrace()` instead of **`printStackTrace()`**..
* Was fighting thru this for while until I installed Eclipse to help figure out the errors.
* IntelliJ was not as friendly for me this time.  Had trouble importing the file into the project, so I moved to eclipse pretty fast.
* And I learned formating for **readme.md** file on github so description is cleaner.  (of course readme name of file is all Uppercase)
